Scheduled Slides let's you set a date range for individual Soliloquy slides so they don't appear before or after.

== Description ==

Important! This plugin is not a slider in and of itself. It is only an addon to the Solilquy slider which is available in the WordPress Repo as a lite version or you can get the [affordable PRO version here](http://solilquywp.com "Soliloquy - WordPress Slider").

Scheduled Slides will add a begin and expiration date to each slide you add within Solilquy. This gives you the ability to add slides that you don't want to display just yet. It also lets you set an expiration date for those time sensitive slides. Set it and forget it!

== Installation ==

Upload the Scheduled Slides for Soliloquy plugin to your site, Activate it, and go to your Soliloquy sliders to start added your dates. That's it.
